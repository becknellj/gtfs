TESTS FOR FEATURE 12

1) making sure that user input is reflected in data structure (when everything is valid
2) making sure that invalid input for trip_id is handles
3) making sure that invalid attribute data is handles

@Test
void inputEqualsAttributeData() {

checks for invalid trip id, time input, and stop sequence
@Test
void invalidAttributeInput()


3 of 3
This test makes sure the user cannot successfully enter an invalid trip id

@Test
void testInvalidTripIdSearch()

Test conducted on Feature 2
Author: Andrew Nebel

Milwaukee GTFS files and comparing two separate
Trip program distances compared to those trips'
distances hand calculated.



Daniel Griffith
This test checks input validation on import files
Should throw IllegalArgumentException if a GTFS file is imported as the wrong type of GTFS file
i.e. stops.txt being imported as routes.txt
@Test
void fileImportInputValidationTest()
